# webpack

Webpack is a library that lets us create a bundle out of JavaScript/React code that can be used in a browser. 

The biggest difference 
is that running Webpack in production mode will minimize our code and decrease 
the size of the project bundle.

there will be a file called main.js that includes our project 
code and is also known as our bundle.
